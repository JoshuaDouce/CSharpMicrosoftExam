Tips: Evrything in exam must exist for example interfaces, classes etc.

Managing Program Flow

---
Thread 
	- Advantage - You have full control of the thread
	- Disadvantage - You have to fully manage the thread and give us alot more than we likely need

---
Thread Pool 
	-The CLR manages a pool of threads optimized based on environment
	-New thread requests are placed in a queue
	-Using the thread pool is the prefered mechanism for managing threads

---
Tasks
	-Tasks represent an asynchronous operation.
	-It will run in the background then notify when it has a result
	-Task reference an action delegate that has an Action Delegate that has return type.
	-It has no parameters but does have a state.
	-To cancel a task you use a CancelationToken and use the property IsCancellationRequested.
	-To reate a cancellation token you need a tokensource.

---
Async/Await
	-This is built on tasks.
	-Async marks an operation asynchronous, to use you need to decorate a method with async keyword.
	-Await signals to wait but it is not done on the main thread therefore not blocking the mian thread.

---
AsParalell()
	-Takes a collection of items and make all operation on thse items run in parallell
	-You have to convert the collection first.

---
Throw
	-To throw an original exception with an originial stack trace you just need to use the keyword throw.

---
Create and use types

---
Constructors
	-The defualt constructor sets all fields either null, 0 or false
	-Setting a private constructor will mean no default constructor is created
	-You cannot inherit from a class using a private constructor
	-Creating a custom constructor means no default is created.
	
---
Generics
	-Genrics are effectively a variable for a type

---
Debugging and Implementing Security

---
Encryption
	-Symetric Encryption - Single key, reversible encryption, good for large data sets.
	-Asymetric Encryption - Two keys, reversible, good for encrypting keys, one key locks othe rkey unlocks
		-One private key only you have
		-One public key you distribute
	-Hashing - Irreversible encryption, hash into cypher text

---
Logging
	-To write to the event log create a new event log, specify a source then use write entry.
	-Trace logging can be done in the app config
		-You need a switch that indicates the level of trace logging
		-Need to indicate where to write it out to
	-To use tracing, new up a tracesource, specify listeners or write to all listeners using trace event
